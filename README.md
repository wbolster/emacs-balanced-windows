balanced-windows.el
===================

This Emacs package provides a global minor mode named `balanced-windows-mode`. When enabled, Emacs will automatically balance windows (keeping them roughly the same size) whenever the window configuration changes, e.g. after splitting or deleting a window.

Installation
------------

```elisp
(use-package balanced-windows
  :config
  (balanced-windows-mode))
```
